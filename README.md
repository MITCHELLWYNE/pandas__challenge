You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

1. Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. 4. Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for this homework assignment and name it PyCitySchools.

5. Add your Jupyter notebook to this folder. This will be the main script to run for analysis.

6. Push these changes to GitHub or GitLab.

## Requirements 
### District Summary (20 points)
1. Calculate the total number of unique schools 
2. Calculate the total number of students 
3. Calculate the total budget 
4. Calculate the average (mean) math score 
5. Calculate the average (mean) reading score
6. Use the code provided to calculate the percentage of students who passed math
7. Calculate the percentage of students who passed reading 
8. Use the code provided to calculate the percentage of students that passed both math and reading 
9. Create a new DataFrame for the above calculations called district_summary 

### School Summary
1. Use the code provided to select the school type 
2. Calculate the total student count 
3. Use the code provided to calculate the per capita spending 
4. Calculate the average test scores 
5. Calculate the number of schools with math scores of 70 or higher 
6. Calculate the number of schools with reading scores of 70 or higher 
7. Use the provided code to calculate the schools that passed both math and reading with scores of 70 or higher 
8. Use the provided code to calculate the passing rates 
9. Create a new DataFrame for the above calculations called per_school_summary 

### Sort Schools in decending order by the Overall Passing Rate

### Math Scores by Grade
1. Use the code provided to separate the data by grade 
2. Group by "school_name" and take the mean of each 
3. Use the code to select only the math_score 
4. Combine each of the scores above into single DataFrame 

### Reading Scores by Grade
1. Use the code provided to separate the data by grade 
2. Group by "school_name" and take the mean of each 
3. Use the code to select only the reading_score 
4. Combine each of the scores above into single DataFrame
